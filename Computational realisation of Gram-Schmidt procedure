"MM Pset1 CP1) 
Work within the setting of question 4), above, so in the space L2w(R) with scalar product (5) and weight function w(x) = exp(−x2).
(a) Define, within Mathematica, the scalar product (5).
(b) Write a short piece of code which realises the Gram-Schmidt procedure for a finite list of functions. In particular, this code should be capable of taking the monomials (1, x, x2, . . . , xn) as an input and returning the orthogonal polynomials (p0, . . . , pn).
(c) Use this code to check your by-hand calculation in question 4) and also apply it to larger monomial lists for n > 2.
(d) Choose some functions in f ∈ L2w(R) and expand them in the monomial basis (p0, . . . , pn) to obtain an approximation f ̃=Sum_k=0 -> k=n ⟨pk,f⟩pk. Compare f and f ̃ by producing a plot."
